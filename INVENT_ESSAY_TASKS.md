1. Assess Detail and Texture Revelation
Evaluate whether the lighting effectively reveals the cat's fur texture, coat patterns, color variations, and fine details such as whiskers, facial features, and the subtle gradations across their body. Determine if the viewer can fully appreciate the intricate beauty and characteristics of the cat's physical appearance.

2. Evaluate Light Source Character and Modeling
Analyze the light source's direction, intensity, and quality, and assess how effectively it models the cat's three-dimensional form. Determine whether the lighting creates intentional and flattering shadows that define facial features and body contours, avoids harsh overexposure or underexposure, and demonstrates thoughtful control over the light to shape how the cat appears.

3. Examine Visual Depth and Subject Separation
Assess whether the lighting creates a clear sense of three-dimensional form and visual separation between the cat and its background. Evaluate how the interplay of highlights and shadows contributes to the cat appearing solid and dimensional rather than flat, and determine whether the cat naturally stands out as the primary subject.

4. Evaluate Emotional Impact and Viewer Resonance
Assess the emotional quality and engagement created by the lighting. Determine whether the lighting draws the viewer in, creates an inviting or compelling mood appropriate to the cat's presentation, and makes the viewer want to linger with and appreciate the photograph and its feline subject.
